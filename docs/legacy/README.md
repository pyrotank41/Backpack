# Legacy Documentation

- **[PRD-legacy.md](./PRD-legacy.md)** - Original combined PRD (superseded by v2.0 PRDs)

## Why These Are Archived

During the v2.0 planning phase, we realized the original PRD was becoming too large and mixing concerns. We split it into three focused PRDs:

1. **PRD-001:** Backpack Architecture (State Management)
2. **PRD-002:** Telemetry System (Observability)
3. **PRD-003:** Serialization Bridge (Config-Driven)

The legacy PRD is kept here for historical reference only.
